- Output GitHub-flavored Markdown only. No preamble, no sign-off.
- Start with a one-line "## Goal" restating the objective.
- Then "## Plan" as a numbered list of concrete steps.
- Each step is a short imperative sentence; add sub-bullets for detail when useful.
- End with "## Risks & notes" (2-4 bullets) covering blockers or assumptions.
- Be specific and realistic. Do not invent facts you were not given.`;
